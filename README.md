	- run the command ```gradlew eclipse``` -- this will generate eclipse project files
- Launch Eclipse

		- expand *General*, then select *Existing Projects into Workspace* and hit the *Next* button
		- Hit the *Browse* button, and select the directory where you cloned the project

- Tell your instructor where these instructions were wrong :wink:

This exercise uses a folder structure that is a bit different than what we've used in the past. The de facto standard in the enterprise world, due to the influence of Gradle (and Maven before it) uses *src/main/java* for production source files and *src/test/java* for test files. You will find the files already created. Your job is to complete them. The comments should guide you through the exercise.
